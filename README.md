## Overview and Origin

Tala is a mobile technology and data science company that is oriented around financial services in emerging markets. More than 2 million people have borrowed through Tala’s smartphone app, which provides instant credit scoring, lending, and other personalized financial services in emerging markets.

Tala provides personalized loans to approved borrowers and builds digital credit history. The company provides instant loans through a mobile app where the entire process happens, from loan application to funds release and status tracking.
Tala was founded on October 1, 2011 by Shivani Siroya, and is the global team is headquartered in Santa Monica, with additional offices in Nairobi, Manila, Dar Es Salaam, Mexico City, Mumbai, and Bangalore.

Shivani worked as an analyst with the UN Population Fund and conducted research across West and Sub-Saharan Africa to study microfinance and other economic development programs. She was spending a lot of time with small business owners and became emotionally invested in their lives. When some of them needed capital for their businesses but had no way to get it, she started lending to them herself. 

When a friend asked her on how she decided who to lend to. This was her first "aha moment"—She realized that non-traditional data that tells a story about people’s lives can be used to make a lending decision. Eventually, she realized that much of this same daily life data was recorded on consumers’ mobile phones and it can be used to determine the credit worthiness. 

Tala has raised a total of $204.4M in funding over 9 rounds. Their latest funding of $110 million was raised on Aug 21, 2019 from a Series D round led by RPS Ventures.


## Business Activities
Tala is solving for a difficult, though potentially lucrative problem—providing loans to a population of unbanked consumers whose credit worthiness is difficult to ascertain. Per one World Bank estimate, about 68% adults (~2.3bn) have no credit data docked with a private bureau, and therefore no credit score.

The company is intending to serve the unbanked customers across developing countries who don’t have access to the traditional banking platforms and no credit history to verify the credit worthiness. 

With Tala using mobile phones to reach the intended customers and gives it unmatched reach in comparison to traditional microfinance companies that primarily focuses on specific regions or countries. 

Company uses up to 10,000 different data points from a smart phone and converts it into a credit score. This goes beyond traditional models, in that the credit score takes into account the network diversity, social connectedness and geographical patterns. This contributes to the data points that build an identity of the customer’s borrowing capacity.

Company uses machine learning and artificial intelligence on these data points to establish patterns and assign the scores to various categories. For instance, consistent travel patterns assure that the customer is either at work or home and pattern shows high repayment probability for such cases.

## Landscape:

The company works in the microfinance space and leverages Mobile technology to server their customers. 

While over the last decade, commercial banks are rooting for impact investing and with digitalization of the sector, it not just about the helping the vulnerable and those below poverty lines rather it is profitable business to get into. 

While the Tala was the first one to enter the space with using personal data for credit worthiness, the model is susceptible to competition. For instance, Branch International was started by Kiva’s founder Matt Flannery in Nairobi completed $170mm Series C to go after the same Market. 

## Results

The company stays competitive in the space of Microfinance with over millions given out as loans and over $1.5mm revenue in 2019. 


## Recommendations

With solid footing in the Microfinance lending space, company should look to explore Micro banking and Insurance to stay competitive in the market.
